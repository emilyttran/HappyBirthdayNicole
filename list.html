      Your love for coffee
      Your love for teas
      Your love for felines
      Your love for the environment
      Your love for average white guys
      Your independence
      Your cute freckles
      Your crooked smile
      Your super cool friends
      Your taste in music
      Your slightly asian eyes
      Your puns
      Your deadpan humor
      Your unbridled positivity.
      Your impressive flexibility
      Your matter-of-fact way of speaking.
      Your pubescent voice
      Your hippy vibe that only you can pull off
      When you mimic other people’s voices
      How expressive you are
      The affection you never fail to give to your friends (even after we refuse it).
